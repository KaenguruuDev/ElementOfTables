# ElementOfTables
---

Element of tables is a small program that provides interactive views of the periodic table as well as the nuclide table.

---

## Periodic Table
In the periodic table, you can see the classic overview of all chemical elements. Clicking one reveals further information about the specific element and displays a small 2D Bohr Model of the atom.

For the future, I'm aiming to extend the viewable data to provide more detailed and sanitized information.

## Nuclide Table
Here you'll find ~3.2k nuclides, colored after their decay types. A search function in the top left allows you to quickly find a specific nuclide (U235 or similar).

**Note**: Currently, the search format is the same as the display format (U235, H1, etc.). In the future, there will be an option to change how it is displayed and the search function will accept different notations as well.

Clicking on a nuclide reveals it's full decay chain in the table and shows more detailed information about the decay processes.


## Help
If you spot an error anywhere, please open up an [`Issue`](https://github.com/KaenguruuDev/ElementOfTables/issues) so that it can be resolved quickly. The [`Discussions`](https://github.com/KaenguruuDev/ElementOfTables/discussions) are also open for everyone to debate over anything where there might be conflicting data.
Similarly, if you have ideas for new features / improvements, both an issue or a discussion if you're unsure are a great way to help improve the program.

Any help is greatly appreciated.


## Disclaimers
The datasets I currently use may contain outdated or incorrect information. Don't use this as a source for your work.
I am maintaining this in my free time and may loose interest / not have enough time to continue to develop it.
